# USELESS FACTS : https://barbouy.github.io/Useless-Facts/

Hello everyone,

My name is **Pierre-Alexandre**, I'm an engineering student that is obsessed by learning web languages. This website isn't my idea, it's an idea from a french video who permit me to learn the base of Nuxt (VueJS framework).

I hope you'll like it and if u have any question, ask me and I'll answer with pleasure.

See you.
